# DSA Programs

Welcome to the DSA Programs repository! This collection features several C++ programs that demonstrate the use of basic to intermediate level data structures. Each program is designed to help you understand different data structures and their applications through practical examples.

## Programs Included

1. **Student Database Management**
   - Creation of a student database.
   - Application of various searching and sorting algorithms to process and manage the student data efficiently.

2. **Circular Queue Implementation**
   - Implementation of a circular queue using an array.
   - Demonstrates queue operations such as enqueue, dequeue, and display.

3. **Stack as an Abstract Data Type (ADT)**
   - Implementation of a stack using a singly linked list.
   - Utilization of this ADT for:
     - Conversion of infix expressions to postfix and prefix.
     - Evaluation of postfix and prefix expressions.

4. **Expression Tree Construction**
   - Construction of an expression tree from postfix and prefix expressions.
   - Execution of recursive and non-recursive traversals:
     - In-order
     - Pre-order
     - Post-order

5. **Binary Search Tree Operations**
   - Implementation of a binary search tree (BST).
   - Execution of fundamental operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of C++ programming.
- Familiarity with data structures and algorithms concepts.
